The first month at IITP has been quite nice. The seniors are really interactive and they have been conducting orientations for different clubs since we joined. Nebula , the fresher's fest , was also really nice. We got to meet a lot of new people with different cultures over there. Overall, I have to say life at IITP has been amazing till date.
